"""How well Claude knows you: predictions Claude logged in claude/predictions.md, scored for calibration.

One line per prediction (see FORMATS.md):
    - 2026-09-27 · 70% · recommend · bet: Status, then recent · got: Status, then recent · hit

Kinds: recommend (a "(Recommended)" option), guess (a stated guess about what you meant or want), draft (something
Claude wrote that you kept or rewrote), habit (a habit made Claude act and you went along or pushed back).
The score is a Brier skill score: 100 = perfectly confident and right, 0 = no better than always saying 50%.
Being 90% sure and wrong costs far more than being 55% sure and wrong.
